# Car Dekho MySQL Project

## Overview

Car Dekho is a MySQL project that aims to manage and store data related to a car dealership. This README file provides an overview of the project, its components, and instructions for setting it up and using it.

## Project Description

Car Dekho is a MySQL database project designed to help manage and organize data for a car dealership. It provides a structured database schema for storing information about cars and other relevant details. This project can be used as a foundation for creating a car dealership management system.

## Database Schema

The Car Dekho database schema includes:

- `cars`: Stores information about the cars available for sale, including details like Name,	year,	selling_price,	km_driven,	fuel,	seller_type,	transmission,	owner,	mileage,	engine,	max_power, torque and	seats.

This database schema can be extended or modified according to your specific needs.

## Usage

1. Connect to your MySQL database using a MySQL client or GUI tool.

2. Use SQL queries to interact with the Car Dekho database. For example:

   - To retrieve a list of available cars:

     **SELECT * FROM** cars_dekho **WHERE** Year = '2023';
     

   - To record a new sale:

    ** INSERT INTO** car_dekho (Name,	year,	selling_price,	km_driven,	fuel,	seller_type,	transmission,	owner,	mileage,	engine,	max_power, torque and	seats) **Values** (Maruti 800 AC,	1994,	45000,	60000, Petrol, Individual,	Manual,	First Owner,	16.1 kmpl,	796 CC,	37 bhp,	59Nm@ 2500rpm, 4)

3. Customize and extend the database schema according to your specific dealership needs.
